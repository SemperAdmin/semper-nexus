# Semper Nexus

A web-based application for monitoring military directives, messages, and publications from multiple sources.

Created by [Nexus](https://nexus.com).

## Features

### Message Types
- **MARADMIN**: Marine Administrative Messages from Marines.mil

- **ALNAV**: All Navy Messages (placeholder - awaiting RSS feed)
- **SECNAV**: Secretary of the Navy Instructions (placeholder - awaiting RSS feed)
- **JTR**: Joint Travel Regulations updates from travel.dod.mil

### Core Functionality
- **Live RSS Feeds**: Fetches latest messages from official sources
- **Advanced Search**: Search by message ID, subject, or keywords
- **Date Filtering**: Quick filter buttons (Today, This Week, 2 Weeks, This Month, 60/90/180 Days, All)
- **Offline Support**: Works offline with cached data via service worker
- **Dark Theme**: Toggle between light and dark modes with persistence

### User Experience
- Modern, responsive design
- Mobile-friendly interface with optimized button layouts
- Real-time search and filtering
- Clear visual hierarchy for messages
- Direct links to source documents
- Installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend-only**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no backend required)
- **CORS Handling**: Automatic fallback through multiple CORS proxies
- **Data Storage**: LocalStorage for caching and offline support
- **RSS Parsing**: DOM Parser for XML processing
- **PWA**: Service worker for offline functionality and fast repeat loads

### CORS Proxy Fallbacks
The app automatically tries multiple CORS proxies in order:
1. Direct fetch (if CORS is enabled)
2. corsproxy.io
3. allorigins.win
4. cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com
5. codetabs.com

Each proxy has a 15-second timeout before trying the next one.

### Performance
- Proxy preference caching for faster loads
- Service worker caching for offline access
- Optimized bundle with Vite

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Open the app in a modern web browser
2. Select a message type tab (MARADMIN, NAVADMIN, JTR, etc.)
3. Use the search box to find specific messages
4. Select a date range with the filter buttons
5. Click "Refresh" to fetch the latest messages

### Search Tips
- Search by message ID: `123/24`
